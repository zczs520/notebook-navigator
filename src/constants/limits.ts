/**
 * Centralized, non-user-configurable limits used to keep background processing predictable.
 *
 * Design goals:
 * - Prevent UI freezes and out-of-memory crashes (especially on mobile).
 * - Bound worst-case work per scan (bytes read, pixels decoded, concurrency).
 * - Keep derived caches (IndexedDB + in-memory LRUs) within reasonable sizes.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - These are "safety rails", not accuracy guarantees (e.g. huge markdown files may fall back to conservative defaults).
 * - Values are intentionally conservative on mobile where memory and CPU budgets are smaller and OS OOM-kills are common.
 * - When changing a limit, consider both: (1) peak memory usage and (2) total work during initial vault scans.

         * Used by:
         * - `MarkdownPipelineContentProvider` when generating preview text and/or word count.
         *
         * Why this exists:
         * - Reading large markdown files allocates a large JS string (often ~2 bytes per code unit), and preview/word-count
         *   extraction can create additional transient allocations. On mobile this can cause jank or OOM.
         *
         * Behavior when exceeded:
         * - The provider skips reading the file body and only applies "safe" updates that can be derived from metadata/frontmatter.
         * - Word count/preview may be set to conservative defaults to avoid repeated reprocessing loops.
